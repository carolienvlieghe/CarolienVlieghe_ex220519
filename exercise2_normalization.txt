UNF Project(Personnel number, Name, Date of birth, lab code, lab name, [research code, research description, research supervisor])
Personnel number in combination with the research code makes the row unique: this is the whole key.

NF --> 1NF: eliminate repeating groups, make sure every row is unique.
1NF: 
	Personnel(Personnel number, Name, Date of birth, lab code, lab name) PK = personnel_number
	PersonnelProject(research code, research description, research supervisor, personnel number) PK = research code
	
1NF --> 2NF: look for partial dependencies and eliminate them (is a non-key attribute only dependent on a part of the whole key?).
2NF: 
	Personnel(Personnel_number, Name, Date of birth, lab code, lab name) PK = Personnel number
	Research(Research code, research description, research supervisor) PK = Research code
	PersonnelProject(project_id, Personnel number, research code) PK = project_id
	
2NF --> 3NF: look for transitive dependencies and elimenate them (is a non-key attribute dependent on another non-key attribute?).
3NF:
	Personnel(Personnel number, Name, Date of birth, lab code) PK = personnel number
	Lab(lab code, lab name) PK = lab code
	Research(Research code, research description, research supervisor) PK = research code
	personnelProject(project_id, Personnel number, research code) PK = project_id
